- 👋 Hi, I’m @i-love-api
- 👀 I’m interested in building cool things with APIs, breaking stuff (ethically), and exploring new tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about cybersecurity, programming, and life itself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves APIs, automation, or hacking tools (legally!).
- 📫 How to reach me: You don’t. I’ll find you if needed. 😉
- 😄 Pronouns: Debug/Deploy
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first API call was probably a 404.
